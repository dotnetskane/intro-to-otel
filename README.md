# Introduction to OpenTelemetry in .NET
_By Peter Nylander 2024_

This is the repo for the talk "Introduction to OpenTelemetry in .NET" by Peter Nylander at the .NET SkÃ¥ne user group event [24/4 2024](https://www.meetup.com/net-skane/events/299895141).

The talk is a simple introduction how to get started with OpenTelemetry in .NET.

The repo is structured like so that each commit represents one step of the presentation

During the talk I used the [.NET Aspire dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard) to easily demonstrate how to view logs, metrics and traces.

Start the dashboard by executing the following command:

`docker run --rm -it -p 18888:18888 -p 4317:18889 -d --name aspire-dashboard -e DOTNET_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS='true' mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/nightly/aspire-dashboard:8.0.0-preview.5`

You can also run [Grafana LGTM](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/03/13/an-opentelemetry-backend-in-a-docker-image-introducing-grafana/otel-lgtm/) as the OpenTelemetry backend. I also showed this briefly.

Start Grafana by executing:

`docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 --rm -ti grafana/otel-lgtm`
